The Lunar Theme (v1.3) by M0dSe7en
I saw that the Link to the Theme was down:
[Broken Link] https://forum.facepunch.com/t/lunar-a-sleek-and-beautiful-theme-for-notepad/119181

So I checked where to find the XML and hopefully made it easier for everyone to download it.

This text is my only contribution(!), so thank M0dSe7en.
