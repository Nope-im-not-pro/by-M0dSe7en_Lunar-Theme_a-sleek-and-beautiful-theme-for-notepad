The Lunar Theme (v1.3) by M0dSe7en\
I saw that the Link to the Theme was down:\
[Broken Link] https://forum.facepunch.com/t/lunar-a-sleek-and-beautiful-theme-for-notepad/119181 [Broken Link]\
\
So I checked where to find the XML and hopefully made it easier for everyone to download it.

This text is my only contribution(!), so thank M0dSe7en.

Please also checkout the repo of **jamunano:**\

I thought jamunanos repo is a wonderful addition.
